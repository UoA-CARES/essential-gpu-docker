# Instruction to use Workstations
(Important) Contact your supervisor first to [make bookings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zhHadk0wmTiC-7sPKSpjd_AZx0OvK8aj4Ujtha3rbNA/edit?usp=sharing)

## List of GPU Workstations
| Name    | IP             | OS           | GPU Driver  | CUDA | GPU          | GPU Mem  |
| ------  | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---- | ------------ | -------- |
| P6000-1 | 130.216.238.11 | Ubuntu 22.04 | 510.108.03  | 11.6 | Quadro P6000 | 24576MiB |

## Connect to the Workstation Remotely using SSH
You can use an SSH client such as Terminal (in macOS) or Command
Prompt (in Windows), on your local machine. Your local machine must be connected to the UoA network (either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable). You need to connect to the UoAâ€™s VPN if you are off-campus. If Open SSH is not installed in your Windows OS, you need to add it as explained [here](https://ittutorials.net/microsoft/windows-10/enable-ssh-windows-10-command-prompt/). Alternatively, you can use other ssh clients, such as [PuttySSH](https://www.putty.org/).

Currently we're using a shared account(myuser1/pass1). Open your terminal and type the following command. We assume you have an active booking for the workstation. ([Booking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zhHadk0wmTiC-7sPKSpjd_AZx0OvK8aj4Ujtha3rbNA/edit?usp=sharing))
```
ssh myuser1@130.216.238.11
```

## Use docker for training your model
Search dockers you want [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

For the quick review, 
```
docker run hello-world
```
Check [nvidia/cuda](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) dockerhub for more tags. 
```
docker run nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi
```

To list the running containers, simply execute the docker ps command, 
```
docker ps
```
To include all the containers present on your Docker host, append the -a option, 
```
docker ps -a
```
To stop one or more running Docker containers, you can use the docker stop command
```
docker stop container-name
```
To start containers, 
```
docker start container-name
```
And you can kill containers. 
```
docker kill container-name
```
To run an interactive shell in a container
```
docker exec -it container-name sh
```

Visit [the official docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) to see all the docker commands and their options. 

Visit [the docker image recommendation page](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) to find images used in the lab.

## Docker volume for the persistant data 
[Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQLrqQm4M0)

In the following example, we create a volume mapped to /home/myuser1/data path. This volume will be mounted in a container. So you can share data between containers. 
```
docker volume create --name datastore --opt type=none --opt device=/home/myuser1/data --opt o=bind
```
To mount the volume to your container,
```
docker run --rm -it --mount source=datastore,target=/data gcr.io/kaggle-gpu-images/python /bin/bash
```
The volume(datastore) is mounded on /data in the container

# (Optional) FileBrowser 
Install [FileBrowser](https://filebrowser.org/installation) to transfer files if you want to use web-based file browser instead termimal. 

Create folder and files to use FileBrowser as a docker container. 
```
mkdir filebrowser
cd filebrowser/
touch docker-compose.yml
touch filebrowser.db
```

Check your uid/gid. We'll use uid/gid for docker-compose.yml.
```
id
```

We need to edit docker-compose.yml. 
```
nano docker-compose.yml 
```

Use your uid:gid instead '1001:1001'. And use your userid instead 'myuser1'. 
```
version: '3'
services:
  file-browser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser
    container_name: file-browser
    user: 1001:1001
    ports:
      - 8082:80
    volumes:
      - /home/myuser1/:/srv
      - /home/myuser1/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```
And run the docker-compose. 
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Visit http://ipaddress:8082 to access FileBrowser.
