# VS Code Server Container Template

Welcome to the VS Code Server Container Template for RunPod. This template is designed to help you set up and run a container that operates the VS Code Server, offering an integrated development environment directly on your RunPod instance.

## What is VS Code Server?

The VS Code Server is a component of Visual Studio Code that allows you to run the editor's backend on a remote server, while keeping the user interface on your local machine. This setup is particularly useful for development scenarios where your runtime environment cannot be hosted on your local machine.

## Usage

This template helps you set up a VS Code Server within a container on RunPod. The resulting setup allows you to leverage the processing power of RunPod's GPU instances while working in the familiar environment of VS Code.

## Additional Resources
